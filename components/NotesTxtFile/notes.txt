Voilation of Cops
08-15-2022
From the streets of Minneapolis to the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, 
unlawful use of force by police can end in death, injury, and devastation. 
As we’ve seen too many times, in the USA and elsewhere, sometimes police kill 
or seriously injure people during arrests fuelled by racism. In countless other 
cases, police are quick to use force in response to protests or demonstrations. 
Throughout 2019 and 2020, Hong Kong police have repeatedly deployed weapons like 
tear gas and rubber bullets in an unlawful way against protesters. All too often, 
officers who kill or injure people after using force unlawfully are not brought to 
justice. That’s why it’s so important to know what your rights are, and to know 
what police are, and aren’t, allowed to do. We need to make sure that police stop 
using force against the law, and that those who kill unlawfully are brought to 
account – no more excuses.
